Poor freakish thing,
there is no escape.

Not until all questions

By you, and by all

00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,532
how did you come to be here?

17
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:46,669
I committed a sin.

18
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:49,705
Give us your sin.

PAUL:
<i>That's easy, isn't it?</i>

20
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:54,076
I was born.

21
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:55,544
As all men must be.

22
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:58,747
Only I weren't
like all other men.

23
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:01,884
In our street,
that was a problem.

24
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:05,521
Lads learned early on
how to scrap.

25
00:02:05,589 --> 00:02:07,623
Only I couldn't get
close enough to scrap back,

00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,825
not with these.

SUZI: The doctors took my legs

00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,461
when I was two years old,

29
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,651
owing to a spinal condition.

30
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,767
After that,
my parents lost faith.

31
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,203
They left me in a basket

32
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,971
on the doorstep
of the children's home.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,741
I never saw them again.

You do not amuse, girl.

Oh, my innocent ones.

How you move my heart.

42
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,159
There can be no shame with you.

43
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:45,661
No shame.

44
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,363
PAUL:
<i>My whole life is shame.</i>

45
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:50,833
<i>My only escape was in the dark.</i>

46
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,584
<i>I could lose myself in it.</i>

47
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,204
<i>There I was transported.</i>

48
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:57,339
<i>I wanted nothing more than</i>
<i>to come to this land</i>

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,575
<i>of opulence and glamour.</i>

50
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:02,311
But when I arrived,
it was the depression.

51
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,947
The country's... and mine.

<i>Hell, there was no work</i>

55

The darkest moment, girl.

56
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:19,828
We would have it.

57
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,130
It was jealousy.

58
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:27,586
<i>Even hate.</i>

59
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,505

62
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,648
I didn't think of those
legs as part of him.

63
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:41,683
Just the things that
I would never have.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,620
He died.

65
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,388
Yes.

66
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:48,323
But he inspired you to perform.

67
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:51,260
He did.

68
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:53,362
And I was tired of the streets.

69
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,030
PAUL:
<i>Tired of being laughed at,</i>

70
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,734
of being attacked,
of being called "Seal Boy."

71
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:01,937
The world hated me.

72
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,306
But no more than I hated myself.

73
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,877
They wanted a monster?

74
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:10,779
I decided to give them one.

75
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:17,820
I could never make
the world love me.

76
00:04:17,888 --> 00:04:19,721
<i>Maybe I could make it fear me.</i>

77
00:04:22,893 --> 00:04:24,059
Why not the face?

78
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:26,128
PAUL:
<i>I thought about it.</i>

79
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:28,564
But at the last minute,
I chickened out.

80
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:30,974
Why?

81
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:36,205
'Cause I have a handsome face.

82
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,376
I have the face of a pretty lad.

83
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,662
Can you imagine this mug
on a normal body?

84
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,416
I could've ruled the world.

85
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,318
(indistinct whispering)

86
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:58,227
You are not the one.

87
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:05,534
There is another, my children.

88
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,036
Another visit I must make.

89
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,183
Maestro?

90
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:22,885
<i>Willkommen.</i>

91
00:05:22,953 --> 00:05:25,521
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Fraulein.

92
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,022
Oh, not at all.

93
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:28,390
I have been expecting you.

94
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,092
Although it was
rather rude of you

95
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,194
to run off like that
after my number.

96
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:35,197
Perhaps you needed to...

97
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,467
collect yourself.

98
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,777
I imagine you don't see such
authentic talent very often.

99
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,707
May I sit?

100
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,313
It would be better over there.

101
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:54,316
We have business to discuss.

102
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:56,585
And you wouldn't be
the first young man to show up

103
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,453
expecting a lesson in love.

104
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,530
Are you going to say something
about my number?

105
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,534
I've been trying out
some new phrasing,

106
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,271
though it is a challenge for
an artist like myself to work

107
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,106
with such run-of-the-mill
accompaniment.

108
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:21,510
I suppose I should
consider myself lucky

109
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:25,113
that there is at least
one freak on the circuit

110
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:28,183
who knows how to read music.

111
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:31,520
They are not known
for their culture.

112
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:34,056
Which is something
we should discuss.

113
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,608
I'm going to need a new arranger

114
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:41,029
if I am to develop
a contemporary nightclub act.

115
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,704
Cat got your tongue?

116
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,474
My talent has been
known to render

117
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:56,178
men speechless,
but you'll have to get over it

118
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:58,614
if we are going
to work together.

119
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,620
It is not your talent
that renders me speechless.

120
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,955
It is your delusional ignorance.

121
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:10,125
Excuse me?

122
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:12,694
You are a tattered
waste of oxygen

123
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:14,763
who bolsters herself
with contempt for others.

124
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:17,199
I am not here to take you on
to greatness, woman.

125
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,601
I am here to take someone
with me to the other side,

126
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,004
perhaps you.

127
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:23,105
Get out of my tent!

128
00:07:23,173 --> 00:07:24,640
This is not amusing.

129
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:32,914
Whoever it is under that mask,

130
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:35,017
you've come to the wrong tent

131
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:36,918
for your silly little
Halloween prank.

132
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:41,356
This isn't a prank, my lovely.

133
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:48,697
No!

134
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,333
(screams) I am their guardian!

135
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:53,502
I'm their minder!
I'm not one of them!

136
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:55,003
I'm not... Don't!

137
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:57,105
Don't, don't, don't.

138
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:00,742
I don't understand.

139
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,945
(crying):
I am not one of them.

140
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:09,618
Oh, I understand.

141
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,521
There is nothing more craven
than a freak like yourself.

142
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,623
Someone who would pretend
to be the benevolent zookeeper,

143
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:16,491
but she is nothing

144
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,028
but a pernicious,
diseased animal herself.

145
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,031
Now...

146
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:28,347
...tell me
all about your darkest hour.

147

00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:49,898
(Jimmy groans softly)

150
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:51,616
What happened?

151
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:56,505
I think we ran out of gas.

152
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:58,707
You think I was born yesterday?

153
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:01,114
What's next? Do you want to go
for a stroll in the woods?

154
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:04,289
Yeah, actually.
We have to get off the road.

155
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,690
There's a curfew.

156
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,026
Unless you want to spend
the night in jail,

157
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,928
we have to hide from the cops.

158
00:10:12,432 --> 00:10:14,432
You coming?

159
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,101
(crickets chirping)

160
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,736
Come on, let's go.

161
00:10:17,804 --> 00:10:19,271
We got to get off the road.
Let's go.

162
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,773
Come on.
Don't-don't touch me!

163
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:23,714
I haven't decided about you.

164
00:10:23,783 --> 00:10:25,650
Well, you're a fortune teller--

165
00:10:25,718 --> 00:10:27,518
can't you tell my intentions?
That's the problem.

166
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,120
I know every guy's intentions.

167
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:30,955
(chuckles) Well, sassy,

168
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:32,490
lucky for you,
you're not my type.

169
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,724
I'm also smart enough
to know that

170
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,326
guys aren't so picky
in the dark.

171
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:37,556
Listen, I'm not the one
you have to worry about, toots.

172
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,863
It's the townies, the cops.

173
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:40,612
Do you have any idea
how much they hate us?

174
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,201
At best, we're tolerated because
we make them feel grateful

175
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,535
they're normal.

176
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,870
So let me get this straight.

177
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,006
A pretty face is not your type?

178
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,877
(vehicle approaching)
Shit. Come on.

179
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,146
We got to go.
Let's go.

180
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,889
Am I gonna die?

181
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:08,059
Listen to me.

182
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:13,998
I'm not gonna die here,

183
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,900
and neither are you.

184
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,605
Is he dead?

185
00:11:20,673 --> 00:11:21,872
No.

186
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:23,374
He's just weak from hunger.

187
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:27,845
The clown makes us watch him,
but he doesn't feed us.

188
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,282
Watch him do what?

189
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,785
Clown stuff.

190
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,407
Come here.
I need you to help me.

191
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,426
I need you to help me
untie this knot.

192
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,598
Come on. Just try.
I can't.

193
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,800
It's too tight.
Look, I need you to just try.

194
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:52,870
Oh, come on. Hurry.

195
00:11:54,107 --> 00:11:56,173
There. There.

196
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:00,545

201
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:48,726
There's only been one car
in the last ten minutes.

202
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,829
Can't we just walk back to camp?

203
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:54,632
When you're right, you're right.

204
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,300
Just in case, let's
stay in the shadows.

205
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,154
Let's go this way.

Shh. Get down.

No! No!

What was that?

212
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:24,462
Nothing good.

213
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,571
Where are you going?

214
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,407
See if I can help her.

215
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,575
Well...

216
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,746
Shit.

217
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:49,019
Thank you for these.

218
00:13:50,823 --> 00:13:53,290

He is in charge now.

225
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,403
He feeds off pain, regret,

226
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:07,405
the delicious moment

Berlin, Munich.

00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:45,561
I hear a copy
even made it to Vienna.

330
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:50,566
I was a star.

331
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:57,306
But my career was over.

332
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,242
It was all over for me.

333
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:09,351
I had the most...

334
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,587
beautiful legs.

335
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:17,860
DEMON FACE:
She is the one.

336
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,094
Yes.

337
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,663
I am the one.

338
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:22,565
Take me, please.

339
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:25,901
I know now.
I can't deny it.

340
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,203
Please.

341
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:28,871
There is nothing left for me.

342
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,239
It's all over.

343
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:32,875
Are you ready?
Yes!

344
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:35,377
Yes, yes, I am ready.

345
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:38,147
I am ready.
Take me.

346
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:41,417
Please. Take me.

347
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:45,054
Take me!
What are you waiting for?!

348
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:47,623
Please! Go on. Please take me!

349
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,759
(gasps)

350
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:53,596
(toy piano playing)

351
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:56,498
Do you hear music?

352
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:02,238
DANDY:
Ladies...

353
00:22:02,323 --> 00:22:04,540
and gentlemen!

354
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:08,460
Creatures of all kinds!

355
00:22:08,546 --> 00:22:11,380
Children of all ages!

356
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:14,717
You nasty little brats.

357
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:16,485
Welcome to the greatest

358
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:18,921
show on...

359
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,973
Earth!

360
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:24,643
Meet my lovely assistant...

361
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:25,761
Tiny Tits.
(muffled screaming)

362
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,897
And...

363
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:31,600
my accompanist...
the Amazing Mr. Clown!

364
00:22:31,686 --> 00:22:32,902
(squealing)

365
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,906
I've always wondered

366
00:22:36,974 --> 00:22:38,574
how this trick was done.

367
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:39,858
Haven't you?

368
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:41,043
Well...

369
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:43,712
let's find out.

370
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,531
Shall we?
(muffled screaming)

371
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,021
No!

372
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:53,789
(laughing) (screaming)

373
00:23:09,073 --> 00:23:11,056
(muffled laughing)

374
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:20,699
Everybody run! Run!

375
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:24,954
Wait!

376
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:26,789
We're not finished!

377
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,924
(both grunting)

378
00:23:52,566 --> 00:23:54,516
Don't stop now.

379
00:23:54,585 --> 00:23:55,884
We came for a show.

380
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,956
Get back here!

381
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,391
I haven't finished my show!

382
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,760
Oh, he's close.

383
00:24:10,812 --> 00:24:12,929
Which way is the road?

384
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:14,597
Just everyone stop, okay?

385
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:16,683
Quiet.

386
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:18,268
The road's that way.

387
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,069
Take them and call
the police, okay?

388
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:22,322
Go!
Come on! Come on!

389
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:24,774
DANDY: It's all trick and
no treat from here on out!

390
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:27,343
Catch me if you can, asshole!

391
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,499
(growls)

392
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,793
You ruined my Halloween!

393
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,013
You stupid girl!

394
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:49,766
I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you,

395
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:52,202
I hate you, I hate you!

396
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,071
If I have to ask
you a second time,

397
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,941
I fear it will be less polite.

398
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:00,043
Remove your mask.

399
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,393
(groaning)

400
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:20,029
Tell me your story.

401
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,497
(moans)

402
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:24,968
Calm yourself.

403
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:27,870
Focus your mind, and
I will understand you.

404
00:25:27,939 --> 00:25:30,273
Begin at the beginning.

405
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,845
It was 1943.

406
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:38,615
Ah, the world in flames.

407
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:42,185
People were in need of
clowns and laughter.

408
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:44,437
(children laughing)

409
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:47,657
TWISTED CLOWN: <i>I was the
special children's clown</i>

410
00:25:47,692 --> 00:25:51,194
<i>to Rusty Westchester's</i>
<i>Traveling Carnival.</i>

411
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:56,249
<i>I made 'em laugh.</i>

412
00:25:58,036 --> 00:26:01,037
<i>I love the children.</i>

413
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:03,039
<i>But not the freaks.</i>

414
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:05,842
<i>They're mean.</i>

415
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,594
MAN: Yeah, I like
it when they sit

416
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,462
on your lap and they
do that wiggle thing.

417
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:10,713
Yeah.
(chuckles)

418
00:26:10,765 --> 00:26:12,382
How'd he get that job, anyway?

419
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,300
Yeah, I mean,
we got the seniority.

420
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:15,718
Yeah.

421
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,437
Well, we ought to
take care of that.

422
00:26:17,522 --> 00:26:18,721
Aye. Aye.
Yeah.

423
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:20,857
Let's go.

424
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:23,142
I feel good.

425
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:25,695
(whispers):
Hey.

426
00:26:27,265 --> 00:26:28,948
Hey, simpleton.
Yeah, you.

427
00:26:29,034 --> 00:26:30,817
Come here, come here.

428
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:31,823
Yeah, come on, come on.

429
00:26:31,903 --> 00:26:33,453
Yeah, come here, come here.

430
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:34,404
Here. Have a smoke.

431
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,791
Have a seat.

432
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:40,627
Sit down, right here.

433
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:44,080
Yeah.

434
00:26:44,165 --> 00:26:46,382
(coughs)

435
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:48,051
(laughs)

436
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:50,503
It... burns my throat.

437
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:52,388
(high-pitched):
"It burns my throat."

438
00:26:52,424 --> 00:26:54,390
How come you talk so stupid?

439
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:55,825
Your mama drop you on your head?

440
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:57,493
How'd you know that?

441
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:59,762
Uh, it wasn't her fault.

442
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:01,064
Too many cocktails.

443
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,516
(all cackling)

444
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,807
It wa... It wasn't so funny.

445
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:13,543
Oh, it's funny all right. Hey.

446
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:16,446
I hear you
like to do funny things

447
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:18,614
with the little kiddies.
Oh...

448
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:21,084
I heard you like to take advantage...
Oh...

449
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:22,852
...'cause they think
you're a simpleton.

450
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:26,456
(chuckles)
No. I love the kids.

451
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:29,592
No, that's not what they say.

452
00:27:29,627 --> 00:27:32,261
(cackling)
Aw, I didn't do nothing bad.

453
00:27:33,348 --> 00:27:34,731
Wait.

454
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:40,069
What did I do?
W-What'd they say, anyway?

455
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,171
Cops are coming soon.
Oh.

456
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,307
They're gonna put you in jail.

457
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:47,009
(laughter)

458
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:49,562
Jail's for bad people.

459
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:52,198
I'm a good person. Mama said so.

460
00:27:52,283 --> 00:27:54,584
Do you hear that?
I think the cops are coming.

461
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:56,536
Uh-oh, you better
scram, simpleton,

462
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:59,589
(chortles)
You better run extra fast.

463
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:01,457
Run, run!
Boo!

464
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,259
(laughter)

465
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,031
(whimpering)

466
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:12,702
Never cared for dwarves.

467
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,404
Power mad, the lot of them.

468
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,339
So they drove you out.

469
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:19,041
Word... travels around

470
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,311
in the carny circuit.

471
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,913
I couldn't...

472
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:27,183
be a clown anymore.

473
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:31,187
<i>So I came home to Jupiter.</i>

474
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:35,191
<i>But Mama had died.</i>

475
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:41,164
<i>I had a idea.</i>

476
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,173
<i>I would turn the garbage</i>

477
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,291
<i>into gold.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

478
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:58,931
<i>Like Rumpelstiltskin.</i>

479
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,019
Uh, how about Spouty?

480
00:29:03,054 --> 00:29:04,137
No.

481
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:06,973
This one...

482
00:29:07,058 --> 00:29:08,124
Kids ain't gonna go for these.

483
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:09,776
Oh, you're wrong.

484
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,361
This will be a big
hit with the kids.

485
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:14,113
I said no.

486
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,132
(tinkling)

487
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:17,283
Look at that one!

488
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,403
Hey, boy.

489
00:29:20,455 --> 00:29:21,821
Don't you want this?

490
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:24,240
Huh? Isn't this
your favorite toy?

491
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,542
He doesn't want
your filthy whirligig.

492
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:28,211
Kids love me.

493
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,880
I know better than anybody
else what kids want.

494
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,515
Hey, hey, keep your distance.

495
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:33,864
You're one of those
twisted types

496
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:35,618
that-that does

for the pinheads.

663
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:02,268
You can't be serious.

664
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:04,336
But it's our faces
on the banner.

665
00:42:04,405 --> 00:42:05,685
But that was last week,
<i>Liebchen.</i>

666
00:42:06,807 --> 00:42:07,973
We took that banner down.

667
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:09,909
Uh, knock, knock?

668
00:42:09,977 --> 00:42:12,211
(chuckles):
Uh, sorry...

669
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,780
to bother you folks--
I, uh... I was hoping

670
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,916
to buy a ticket to the show,

671
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:18,984
but it seems to be sold out.

672
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,519
I'm here from, uh,

673
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:22,488
out of town.

674
00:42:22,557 --> 00:42:24,557
Yeah, Hollywood,

675
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,959
California, is
where I call home.

676
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,661
Hollywood?

677
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,764
Richard Spencer.

678
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,066
Talent scout.

679
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,602
I think we can find you a seat.

680
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,304
Ah...
(laughs softly)

681
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,110
Oh, for the love of Christopher!

682
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:48,147
Really?
Is that what you tore up

683
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:49,782
all those fine things to make?

684
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,451
Don't let your mother
see you like that.

685
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,053
She's been running
around all day

686
00:42:54,121 --> 00:42:55,888
trying to find you
the proper costume--

687
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:57,323
not that you would
appreciate it.

688
00:42:57,391 --> 00:42:58,924
So go change, and take this tray

689
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,138
to your mother.

690
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:02,828
She's feeling a weakness
from running around.

691
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,797
Halloween is over.

692
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,715
Get bent and take this tray.

693
00:43:10,304 --> 00:43:12,721
Enough of this!
I'm not afraid of you.

694
00:43:12,807 --> 00:43:14,873
You little made-in-
the-shade white boy.

695
00:43:14,942 --> 00:43:16,842
You can barely wash
your own ass.

696
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:18,510
I know, 'cause I wash

697
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:20,045
your shitty drawers.
(chuckles)

698
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:22,431
I'll take it myself. Move!

699
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,732
